# How to Handle a Difficult SME

As a technical writer, you have to work with Subject Matter Experts. They are the specialists of your product, process or technology. They are often very busy. What can you do to convince them to help you?

:blue_book: Tips:
## Talk to your SME. 
Try to build a personal relationship with your SME. First, they should know you as a person. Then, it is easier to work together.
## Offer to do something for them. 
Help your SME with a work issue. Everyone likes helpful people. Bring cake to work or buy your SME lunch. 
## Prepare for the meeting
When you meet your SME, learn everything that you can about your technical issues. Prepare specific questions to ask your SME. 
## Be empathetic.
Be calm if your SME does not respond quickly. Send a reminder e-mail.
## Value your own time and work.
Set ground rules. Respectfully inform the SME about your deadlines and work hours.

Good luck!
