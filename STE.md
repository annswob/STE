## Talk to your SME. 
Try to build a personal relationship with your SME. First, they must know you as a person. That way, it is easier to work together.
## Offer to do something for them. 
Help your SME with a work issue. Everyone likes helpful people. Bring cake to work or buy your SME lunch. This can help to build a stronger relationship. 
## Prepare for the meeting.
When you meet your SME, learn everything about the problematic issues. Prepare specific questions to ask your SME. 
## Be empathetic.
Remain calm if your SME does not respond quickly. Send them a reminder e-mail.
## Value your own time and work.
Set ground rules. Respectfully inform the SME about your deadlines and work hours.
