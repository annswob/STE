How to Handle a Difficult SME

As a technical writer, you will often have to deal with Subject Matter Experts: the very busy people who are the specialists of your product, process or technology. It is not easy to spot them: they tend to hide in their offices and only come out for other important people. And although they know everything, they are not always so keen to share that knowledge with you. 
So what to do if you don’t understand what you’re writing about, the deadline is creeping up, and the SME cannot be bothered to help you? 
:blue_book: Here are some tips!
Talk to them. I know what you’re going to say: thanks, Sherlock, never thought of that! But I mean actually talk to them. On a human level. Try to establish some personal contact first: schedule a video call or drop by their office (that’ll take them by surprise!). Introduce yourself. Ask about their day. Smile. That way, they’ll know who you are and that you are a delight to be around.
Offer to do something for them. Reciprocity is one of the oldest social norms. If you help them with something professionally, they will feel obliged to give you a hand as well. This also explains why bringing cake to work or buying someone lunch is so effective: just use it wisely.
Be concise and know your stuff. Your SME probably doesn’t want to waste their time (Sherlock strikes again), so they’ll appreciate that you did your best to prepare for the meeting.
Be empathic. If they don’t get back to you soon enough, don’t take it personally. It’s (probably) not you, just their heavy workload. However, make sure to respectfully let them know your deadlines, for example by sending a reminder e-mail.
Remember to also value your time and your work. Yes, SMEs are very important, but so are technical writers: otherwise, who would create all this documentation that nobody reads? In all seriousness though, if you are going to work with this particular SME for a longer time, it is best to establish some ground rules. If all your soft skills are not enough, you might need to use the superpower of boundaries. Always be nice, but firm: after all, whatever helps the documentation, helps the end user and, as a result, helps the company.
May the force be with you and good luck!
