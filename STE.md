# How to Handle a Difficult SME

As a technical writer, you have to work with Subject Matter Experts. They are the specialists of your product, process or technology. They are often very busy. What can you do to convince them to help you?

:blue_book: Tips:
## Talk to your SME. 
Try to build a personal relationship with them. It is easier to work with somebody that you like. 
## Offer to do something for them. 
Help them with a work issue. This Reciprocity is one of the oldest social norms. If you help them with something professionally, they will feel obliged to give you a hand as well. This also explains why bringing cake to work or buying someone lunch is so effective: just use it wisely.
Be concise and know your stuff. Your SME probably doesn’t want to waste their time (Sherlock strikes again), so they’ll appreciate that you did your best to prepare for the meeting.
Be empathic. If they don’t get back to you soon enough, don’t take it personally. It’s (probably) not you, just their heavy workload. However, make sure to respectfully let them know your deadlines, for example by sending a reminder e-mail.
Remember to also value your time and your work. Yes, SMEs are very important, but so are technical writers: otherwise, who would create all this documentation that nobody reads? In all seriousness though, if you are going to work with this particular SME for a longer time, it is best to establish some ground rules. If all your soft skills are not enough, you might need to use the superpower of boundaries. Always be nice, but firm: after all, whatever helps the documentation, helps the end user and, as a result, helps the company.
May the force be with you and good luck!
